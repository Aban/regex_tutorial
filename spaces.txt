The solution was obviously to compile the last versions of llvm, 


      clang and libc++ from sources. Because I use my computer to hack 

   some Objective-C code I didn’t want to mess my system installing 

             new versions of llvm and clang so I’ve tried to install these on 
			a test Linux box. After a few hours of struggle I was able to 

  compile C++11 code that uses regular expressions and raw strings 
         literals on Linux! This was interesting enough to deserve a 


      separate post on my blog and hopefully will help others to get 
             started with clang++ and libc++ on their Linux boxes.
